## About the program
I decided to work this project as a console application. My main goal from the beginning was
to work on the logic and the creation of a formula to implement the Mold Index as well as implement
Entity Framework Code first approach.
EF presented some challenges, but at the same time, it simplified others.

## About the Formula
I studied many papers and articles about Mold as a subject. I consulted even two friends of mine, one
Biologist and one Agronom engineer. Although not in their specific field of expertise, they managed
to give me links to different articles with precise information from where I did base my study.
In the "About" folder, there is a document explaining in more detail the process I went threw while
creating the formula.

## About Autumn and Winter
In the "About" folder there is a PNG file that explains the logic behind the algorithm that calculates
whether there is a Meteorologic Autumn/winter or not.

## Setup
To clone this project, install it locally running the followind command from the CLI/Terminal:

```
$ gh repo clone Julio-German-Gutierrez/WeatherProject_v1
```
